# Cabpool Application 

## Introduction
This project is being made for the course CSD207 under the guidance of Professor Anuradha Ravi in the semester of Monsoon 2017.

## About the Project
Cabpooling is a huge concern in an isolated, residential university like Shiv Nadar University. It has become a part of the process while planning to go anywhere. Although Gmail is an easy platform for cabpool requests, it is not convenient at all because of the following reasons,
1. Important messages might get lost in a flood of cabpool mails.
2. It is essentially a spam message for people who do not want to cabpool.
3. You require the mailing list to send cabpool requests, or reply all to an existing thread which is a slow process.
4. It is not easy to keep a track of people interested in your offer unless they message you on Whatsapp or call.
5. Privacy is a huge concern, as you do not want to share your number out there in the public.

In such a scenario, there is a need for such an app which will be secure, and easy to use at the same time. Cabpool Application does the exact same thing.
